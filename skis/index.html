        <h3>Skis + Bindings + Boots + Poles - $250 OBO</h3>
        <p>
            Hello!  I have a full youth set up for sale (skis, bindings, boots, poles) - these would be great for anyone looking for a solid pair of skis, beginner through advanced.  They have twin tips so they are perfect for someone who wants to get into the terrain park, but they also make a great all around the resort ski.
        </p>
        <p>Skis:
            <ul>
                <li>Armada ARV 84s - 2020</li>
                <li>Length - 142cm (good ski for someone 4'5" to 5')</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
